00:01.528 --> 00:02.894
Oh, I'm okay. I will be.

00:02.281 --> 00:06.960
I said she could stay with us, Mum. I just thought she feels better.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.970
Yeah, of course she can.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.452
Oh, this won't be for long.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.809
Well, you can stay as long as you want, my love.

00:11.141 --> 00:14.276
You really missed you.

00:13.826 --> 00:14.067
Pops.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.025
Great to see you, love.

00:16.000 --> 00:16.081
Oh.

00:17.181 --> 00:20.317
All right, shall we get you off to bed, then?

00:19.482 --> 00:21.151
You should have given me some room

00:22.005 --> 00:24.719
and I'd have put the electric blanket on.

00:23.161 --> 00:23.966
Sorry. All right, Della.

00:24.020 --> 00:24.201
Freeze.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.667
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:28.624 --> 00:29.007
All right, then.

00:29.623 --> 00:30.548
Freeze them up there.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.671
In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

00:34.281 --> 00:36.548
The middle-aged woman opens her green case.

00:38.201 --> 00:39.286
Do you want, yeah, PJs?

00:40.020 --> 00:40.161
Yeah.

00:42.382 --> 00:43.769
Lifting a bundle of pajamas,

00:44.080 --> 00:45.869
Peter finds a sheet of paper labeled

00:46.321 --> 00:49.251
Lancaster North Hospital Discharged Sheet.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.892
He closes the suitcase and brings glory to the pajamas.

00:54.228 --> 00:54.832
There you go.

00:54.242 --> 00:54.705
Thank you.

00:55.663 --> 00:56.729
He picks up the locket.

00:57.141 --> 00:57.624
You kept it.

00:58.888 --> 01:00.000
Oh, of course.
