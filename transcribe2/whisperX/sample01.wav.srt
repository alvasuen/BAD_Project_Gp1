1
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:02,894
Oh, I'm okay. I will be.

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:06,960
I said she could stay with us, Mum. I just thought she feels better.

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,970
Yeah, of course she can.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,452
Oh, this won't be for long.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,809
Well, you can stay as long as you want, my love.

6
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:14,276
You really missed you.

7
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:14,067
Pops.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,025
Great to see you, love.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,081
Oh.

10
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,317
All right, shall we get you off to bed, then?

11
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:21,151
You should have given me some room

12
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,719
and I'd have put the electric blanket on.

13
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:23,966
Sorry. All right, Della.

14
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,201
Freeze.

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,667
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:29,007
All right, then.

17
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:30,548
Freeze them up there.

18
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:33,671
In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

19
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:36,548
The middle-aged woman opens her green case.

20
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,286
Do you want, yeah, PJs?

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,161
Yeah.

22
00:00:42,382 --> 00:00:43,769
Lifting a bundle of pajamas,

23
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,869
Peter finds a sheet of paper labeled

24
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,251
Lancaster North Hospital Discharged Sheet.

25
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,892
He closes the suitcase and brings glory to the pajamas.

26
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:54,832
There you go.

27
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:54,705
Thank you.

28
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:56,729
He picks up the locket.

29
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:57,624
You kept it.

30
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, of course.
