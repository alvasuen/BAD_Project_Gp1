1
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:28,959
I heard that you settled down, that you found a girl and you're married now.

2
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:40,676
I heard that your dreams came true Guess you gave your things I didn't give to you

3
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:52,559
Oh, friend, why are you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back

4
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,376
Oh, right from the light

5
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:59,838
I hate to turn up out of the blue

6
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,577
Uninvited but I couldn't stay away

7
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:05,939
I couldn't fight it, I had hoped you'd see my face

8
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,597
And that you'd be reminded that for me

9
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,954
It isn't over

10
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,773
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,277
I wish nothing but the best on you too

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,638
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,819
Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it hurts instead

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,433
Sometimes it lasts and lasts, but sometimes it doesn't stay

15
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:57,739
You know how the time flies only

16
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Yesterday was the time of our lives

17
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,799
We were born and raised in a summer haze

18
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:18,739
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

19
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:22,139
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited

20
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,880
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it

21
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,839
I had hoped you'd see my face

22
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:30,416
And that you'd be reminded that for me

23
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:34,577
It is nowhere

24
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:41,474
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

25
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:49,959
I wish nothing but the best for you too

26
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:56,538
Don't forget me, I think I'll remember you since

27
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,634
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

28
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,979
Nothing compares, no worries or cares

29
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,000
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,255
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

31
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:28,234
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,872
I wish nothing but the best for you

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,337
Don't forget me, I'll be

34
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,937
I'll remember how you say

35
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:46,818
Sometimes it lasts in love

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,168
But sometimes it hurts instead

37
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:56,493
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

38
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,499
I wish nothing but the best for you too

39
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:12,398
Don't forget me, I think I'll remember who you say

40
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,593
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,071
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
