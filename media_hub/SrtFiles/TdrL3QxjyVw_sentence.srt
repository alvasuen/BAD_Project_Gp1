1
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:15,859
Remember, always love you, bye!

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:41,711
I just wanted you to know that baby you're the best

3
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,378
I got my red dress on tonight

4
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,557
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight

5
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,859
Throw my hair up real big, beauty queen style

6
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,698
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

7
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,939
Oh my god, I feel it in the air

8
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,939
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,019
Honey, I'm, I'm fine, I feel it everywhere

10
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:24,418
Nothing scares me anymore

11
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,336
Kiss me hard before you go

12
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,697
Summertime suddenly

13
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:36,997
I just wanted you to know

14
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:40,310
That the day will come

15
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,603
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

16
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,338
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,559
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

18
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,875
Oh, oh, oh

19
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,916
I'm feeling electric tonight

20
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,077
Cruising down the coast, going about 99

21
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:14,319
I'm a bad baby by my heavenly side. I know if I go I die happy

22
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,014
I'm happy tonight

23
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:18,520
Oh my god

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,297
I feel it in the air

25
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,338
Tell her from miles above

26
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,499
All sizzling like a snare

27
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,479
Honey I'm, I'm fine

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,520
I feel it everywhere

29
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:32,499
Nothing scares me anymore

30
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:36,479
Kiss me hard before you go

31
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:40,399
Summer time silence

32
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:49,115
I just wanted you to know, baby, you missed me.

33
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,351
I got that summertime, summertime sadness.

34
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:00,439
Got that summertime, summertime sadness.

35
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,460
Got that summertime, summertime sadness.

36
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,598
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

37
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,939
Think I'll miss you forever

38
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:16,836
Like the stars meet the sun in the morning sky

39
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:20,074
Late is better than never

40
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:26,237
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna try

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,221
Try

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,557
I got that summertime, summertime sadness

43
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,391
Summertime, summertime sadness

44
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:43,179
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

45
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,735
Oh, oh, oh, oh

46
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:49,776
Kiss me hard before you go

47
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:54,138
Summertime sadness

48
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,276
I just wanted you to know

49
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,203
You
