1
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:05,545
How long before I get in?

2
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,693
Before it starts, before I begin

3
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:27,879
How long before you decide

4
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:31,115
But before I know what it feels like

5
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:35,537
Where to, where do I go?

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,974
If you never tried then you'll never know

7
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:43,618
How long do I have to climb

8
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:47,618
Up on the side of this mountain of mine

9
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,919
Look up, I look up at night

10
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:10,819
Planets are moving at the speed of light

11
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:18,358
Climb up, up in the trees Every chance that you get is a chance you seize

12
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:26,879
How long am I gonna stand When my head's stuck under the sand

13
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:33,937
I'll stop before I can stop Or before I see things the right way up

14
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,518
All that noise and all that sound

15
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:48,277
All those places I got found

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,899
Birds go flying at the speed of sound

17
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:58,000
Until I show you how it all began

18
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:01,678
Birds can fly from the underground

19
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,557
If you could see it then you'd understand

20
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,000
Ideas that you'll never find

21
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,678
All the inventors can never design

22
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:26,778
The buildings that you put up

23
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:30,879
What you build and shine are all made up

24
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,296
A sign that I couldn't read

25
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:38,195
Or a light that I couldn't see

26
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:41,959
Some things you have to believe

27
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:46,196
But others are puzzles, puzzle and room

28
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:52,698
All that noise and all that sound

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,761
All those places I got from

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,618
Birds got flying at the speed of sound

31
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,693
To show you how it all began

32
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,336
Birds came flying from behind the ground

33
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,637
If you could see it then you'd understand

34
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:22,939
Oh, when you see it then you'll understand

35
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:37,000
All those signs, tell me what they meant

36
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,939
Some things you can't invent

37
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:44,959
Some get made and some get sent

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,988
Ooh, the birds go flying at the speed of sound

39
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,758
To show you how it all began

40
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,698
Birds keep flying from the underground

41
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,819
If you can see it then you'll understand

42
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,685
Oh, when we see it then you'll understand
